    "At its core, the pattern is simple: provide single purpose tools that do their one thing exceptionally well, and then take these tools and chain them together perform most of the tasks you can imagine needing to do. \n",

    " The result is a system that is at once both relatively easy to use, but also so multi-faceted that it can take many years to master fully. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been my experience that many users learn what they need to do to accomplish a task and then build on knowledge when they need to solve a new task.  All the while, adding their favorite programs and approaches to their personalized toolbox. However, there always remains parts of the system to discover.  Moreover, there almost always different ways to solve the same problem with none of them being necessarily better or worse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that even users who have years of experience using Linux or Unix (like myself) can be pleasantly (or last least amusingly) surprised by learning about a previously unknown (to them) option to a command or even a command itself.  It keeps it fresh, always leaving from to learn more, improve your technique, and hone your craft, much like any more traditional artisan. \n",
